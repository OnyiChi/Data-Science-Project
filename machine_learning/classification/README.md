# Breast Cancer Classification

This repository contains code for analyzing and reporting on breast cancer data. The goal is to provide insights into breast cancer incidence, risk factors, and survival rates based on the dataset.

## Introduction

Understanding breast cancer trends and factors influencing its occurrence and outcomes is crucial for healthcare professionals and policymakers. This project utilizes data analysis techniques to investigate patterns in breast cancer incidence, risk factors, and survival rates.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Breast_Cancer_Data.csv`, which includes the following columns:

- ID: Unique identifier for each patient.
- Diagnosis: Indicates whether the tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B).
- Other features: Attributes describing characteristics of the tumor, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.
- 

## Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps include:
1. Importing the dataset.
2. Renaming columns for consistency.
3. Checking for missing values.
4. Encoding categorical variables (if any).

## Data Visualization

Various plots are created to understand the distribution of different attributes and their relationships.

## Analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA techniques are applied to uncover insights into breast cancer data, such as identifying patterns, correlations, and potential risk factors.

### Model Building

Machine learning models may be constructed to predict breast cancer diagnosis or survival rates based on patient features.

### Logistic Regression

A logistic regression model may be utilized to predict the likelihood of tumor malignancy based on patient characteristics.

## Results

Insights gained from the analysis provide valuable information for medical professionals, researchers, and policymakers. Understanding breast cancer trends and risk factors can aid in early detection, treatment planning, and public health interventions.
